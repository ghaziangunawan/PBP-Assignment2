**- Explain the difference between JSON, XML, and HTML!**<br>

**HTML**<br> HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for building web pages/ web applications. HTML describes the structure of web pages and gives the browser the information how to display the content for the web page. HTML consists of series of elements where that elements label the parts of the contents <br>

**XML**<br> XML which stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Just like HTML, XML is also a markup language, but its made for storing and transporting data unlike HTML which are built for the structure of web pages. XML does not do anything but solely just for carrying data where its content is the information with tags<br>

**JSON**<br> 
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is commonly used for data storage and transfer, in JSON, it is similiar with HTML but it serves different purpose where HTML serves for making the structures of web pages while JSON is for storing and transfering data where everything is represented as an object consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays in JSON.
