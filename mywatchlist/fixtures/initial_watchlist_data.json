            "review": " It's surprising! And shocking! Which means good. The cinematography was so epic but slowly the excitement table turned. The appearance of the ghosts sometimes felt wrong and too much, so it felt like a 'ghost show' for me.The climax part was the anticlimax for me. There were repetitive flashing lights and eerie sounds that ended up distracting and triggering photosensitivity. This movie also had alot of fuzzy moves from the camera that maybe annoying. Flash warning is really needed to be given."
