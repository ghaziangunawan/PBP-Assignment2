# Assignment 6

**-Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming.**<br>
<br>
Asynchronous allows parallel and independent which means when user create a request the data is downloaded in the background so user does not have to wait for the data. While <br>
in synchronous programming it only allows one request at a time so user have to wait for the data to be loaded before doing anything.<br>
because the parallel and independent property of asynchronous. It allows for greater throughput because user is not restricted by waiting a request to be completed hence it allows for more efficiency.



**-When Implementing Javascript and AJAX, there is an application in the paradigms of Event-Driven Programming. Describe the reasoning for those paradigms and state some examples of its application.**<br>
<br>
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm which the main focuses is the flow of the program is driven by user event such as mouse-clicks and entering text which will be handled by event-handler which will ensure
that the appropriate response will be generated. An example of this is when user clicks "create task" button then it will route to the appropriate function

**- Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX.**<br>
<br>
Implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX can be seen when the page does not have to refresh when user request a certain task such as creating a new object,
updating object or deleting it. Without AJAX after every creation, update, or deletion the page will have to reload in order to show the updated page.
